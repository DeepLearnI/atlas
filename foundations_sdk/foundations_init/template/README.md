# Foundations project

This project template was generated with `foundations-init`. In
this project you'll find the following structure:

### Config

/config
	default.config.yaml

Configurations define how your job will run. This uses the local deployment type as default. Find more information about configs and other deployment types on our docs page.

### Project code

/project_code
	driver.py
	model.py
	README.md

The `project_code` directory is where all your model code should go, as well the driver application which tells Foundations how to structure stages.

...what is driver file
...what is model file

### Post processing

/post_processing
	results.py

If you want to read and interact with experiments you've run, you'll add the code to the `post_processing` directory to be able to access experiment results.

### Data

/data

This is where you'll put the data to use in your model.
