JIRA Ticket link:

For Reviewer:

* Do acceptance tests properly cover AC?
* Do acceptance tests match real user behaviour?
* Think about how you would have solved the problem:
   * Look for abstractions.
   * Think like an adversary, but be nice about it.
   * Think about libraries or existing product code.
   * Does the change add compile-time or run-time dependencies (especially between sub-projects)?
* Does the PR only cover 1 subtask, and no more than that
* Critique data and distribution of features for acceptance tests
* Has implementation caused unforeseen backwards compatibility issues?
