<h1>Allocating Resource for Deployments</h1>
The following method(s) is used to specify infrastructure resources for running jobs, if desired. Users should be able to specify the amount of GPUs and RAM they'd like the job to use, in order to speed up or prioritize jobs.

**NOTE:** These features are **EXPERIMENTAL** and may be subject to change in future releases. In addition, this only works for specific version of the Foundations Job orchestrator (scheduler), please confirm with the Dessa integrations team if this will work for your setup.

In addition, using the feature will set resources for the current and future jobs, unless this feature is run again to remove any specific resource allocation.
