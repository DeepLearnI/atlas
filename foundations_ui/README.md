# Instructions for deploying the Foundations UI
1. Make a ```ui.config.yaml``` file that duplicates the config.yaml settings of the job you are running. 
For example, if you're running the logistic_regression example locally, copy the ```foundations/examples/example_config/local_deploy.config.yaml``` file and paste it into the ```foundations/foundations_ui``` folder

2. Run ```./run_script.sh``` in terminal from the ```foundations/foundations_ui``` folder
